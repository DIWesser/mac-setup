# macOS-Setup

This is a fork of David Prandzioch's Homebrew based [OSX setup script](https://gist.github.com/dprandzioch/84f44e3c271d3c4cf3865969c97244a3) which I found through his [blog post](https://www.davd.eu/os-x-automated-provisioning-using-homebrew-and-cask/). It's also me throwing an old project into Github as a way of puzzling through Git. My appologies for weird commits, and etiquitte errors.
