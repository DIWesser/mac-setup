# macOS Setup

This is a fork of David Prandzioch's Homebrew based [OSX setup script](https://gist.github.com/dprandzioch/84f44e3c271d3c4cf3865969c97244a3) which I found through his [blog post](https://www.davd.eu/os-x-automated-provisioning-using-homebrew-and-cask/). It's also me throwing an old project into Github as a way of puzzling through Git. My appologies for weird commits, and etiquitte errors. 

## Usage

1. Download `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIWesser/macOS-Setup/master/mac-setup.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and move to (`cd`) the directory you have downloaded it too.
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x mac-setup.sh`
4. Run it: `sudo ./mac-setup.sh`

That's it. There are still a few things that I haven't figured out how to add to the script. A todo list will be put on the desktop that lists everything you will need to do manually.
